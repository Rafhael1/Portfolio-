      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">I am a Front-End Web Developer from Brazil.
        <br>
        I have experience developing Websites with <mark>Javascript</mark> and its frameworks (shown on my <a href="/resume">resume</a>), also, I have experience developing cross platform mobile applications with React Native, and desktop applications with Electron. 
        <br>
        I have some knowledge of Python as well, I wouldn't call myself a Python expert, but with python I've previously built automation bots with Selenium, and I intend to learn flask this year. 
        <br>
        Even though I focus on being a front-end developer, I also have experience with back-end technologies including <mark>Node.Js</mark> and NoSQL databases like <mark>MongoDB</mark>.
        <br>
        Coding is not my only passion though, I love studying economics and business as well.
        You can see all the frameworks that I am familiar with on my <a href="/resume">resume</a>. </p>
